## 1 (10 points) Predictive Model Comparison

Simulate four predictive distributions with the following criteria for instance( 1 might be N(0,1) and 2 might be N(0,10):

1. Narrow predictive interval centered around outcome.
2. Wide predictive interval centered around outcome.
3. Narrow predictictive interval with outcome in tail.
4. Wide predictive interval with outcome in tail.

Then simulate 100 responses and calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), and CRPS. Discuss the differences and make a case for, or against, probabilistic forecasting.
